# **Stockfish-DQN-Agent**

ðŸŒŸ *Optimized Chess RL Trainer using DQN vs Stockfish. Built with PyTorch and python-chess, it learns using per-move rewards from Stockfish evaluations. Implements Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and parallel CPU/GPU execution for faster training. The agent dynamically adjusts Stockfish skill level based on performance.* ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

Welcome to the Stockfish-DQN-Agent repository! This project focuses on creating a powerful chess Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent utilizing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to train against the renowned Stockfish chess engine. By leveraging the capabilities of PyTorch for deep learning and python-chess for chess board manipulation, this agent learns from Stockfish evaluations and refines its strategy over time. The inclusion of Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) enhances training efficiency, while parallel processing on both CPU and GPU accelerates the learning process.
